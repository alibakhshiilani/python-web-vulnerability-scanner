# Python Web Application Scanner

This is an Python Web Application Scanner that uses customizable payloads to detect vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, LFI, and RCE.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alibakhshiilani/python-web-vulnerability-scanner.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Customize the payloads in the `payloads` directory as needed.
4. Update the configuration settings in `config.py` as needed.
5. Run the scanner: `python scanner.py`
6. View the report of vulnerabilities found in `report.txt`.

## Usage

The scanner can be customized by editing the payloads in the `payloads` directory and the configuration settings in `config.py`. The scanner can be run using the `scanner.py` script, and the results will be output to a report file specified in `config.py`.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the Python Web Application Scanner:

```bash
# Run the scanner using the default configuration settings
